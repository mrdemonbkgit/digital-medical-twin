# React Component Rules

## Before Creating/Modifying Components

1. Read /docs/development/COMPONENT_LIBRARY.md for existing patterns
2. Check /docs/development/CODING_STANDARDS.md#naming-conventions
3. Review similar components in src/components/ for consistency

## Component Structure

- Use functional components with TypeScript
- Define props interface above component
- Export component as default at bottom of file
- Co-locate component-specific types in same file

## File Naming

- Components: PascalCase (e.g., `TimelineEvent.tsx`)
- Hooks: camelCase with `use` prefix (e.g., `useTimeline.ts`)
- Utils: camelCase (e.g., `formatDate.ts`)
