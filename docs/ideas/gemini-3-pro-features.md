# Digital Medical Twin - Feature Proposals
*Generated by Gemini 3 Pro*

Based on an analysis of the current codebase and 2025 industry trends for Personal Health Records (PHR), the following features are proposed to elevate the "Digital Medical Twin" from a passive tracker to a true intelligent assistant.

## 1. Live "Twin" Sync (Wearable Integration)
**Current State:** "Metrics" (heart rate, sleep, etc.) rely on manual entry or static file imports.
**Proposal:** Implement automated syncing with **Apple Health / Google Health Connect** or direct APIs (Oura, Whoop).
**Value:** Real-time data population allows the AI to correlate daily habits (sleep, steps) with clinical outcomes (blood pressure, biomarkers) without user effort, creating a truly "living" twin.

## 2. Proactive AI Health Insights (The "Coach")
**Current State:** The "AI Historian" is currently *reactive*, waiting for user queries.
**Proposal:** A "Morning Briefing" or "Weekly Analysis" dashboard widget where the AI proactively surfaces insights.
*   *Example:* "Your sleep quality has dropped 15% since starting Medication X."
*   *Example:* "You haven't logged your Vitamin D in 3 days."
**Value:** Shifts the burden of analysis from the user to the system, providing actionable intelligence.

## 3. "Doctor Prep" Mode
**Current State:** Users have data, but summarizing it for a 15-minute clinical consultation is difficult.
**Proposal:** A dedicated "Prepare for Appointment" workflow.
*   **Input:** User selects a date range and focus area (e.g., "Thyroid Health", "Annual Checkup").
*   **Output:** AI generates a concise 1-page PDF summary tailored for a clinician, highlighting:
    *   Key trends and anomalies (e.g., "TSH is trending up").
    *   Adherence to medications and lifestyle interventions.
    *   *Suggested questions* for the patient to ask the doctor.
**Value:** Tangible utility that directly improves medical outcomes and doctor-patient communication.

## 4. Visual Body Map Interface
**Current State:** The interface is primarily list and timeline-based.
**Proposal:** An interactive 3D or 2D SVG body map.
*   Clicking the **Liver** displays liver enzymes (ALT, AST) and related interventions.
*   Clicking the **Heart** shows BP trends, HRV, and cardio metrics.
**Value:** Provides an intuitive, visual way to navigate health data, reinforcing the "Digital Twin" concept and making the data more accessible.

## 5. Smart Reminders & Adherence Tracking
**Current State:** No notification system exists for medications or routine tasks.
**Proposal:** A notification system (via browser push or email/SMS using Supabase Edge Functions) for:
*   **Medication Reminders:** "Time to take your Magnesium."
*   **Re-test Alerts:** "It's been 3 months since your last lipid panel; consider re-testing."
**Value:** Improves compliance and ensures long-term data consistency.

### Recommendation
**"Doctor Prep" Mode** is recommended as the first step. It is a high-value, low-risk feature that leverages the existing AI capabilities and data structures without requiring complex external API integrations immediately.
